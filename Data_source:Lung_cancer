#### 📑 Description

This dataset provides a rich source of **demographic, behavioral, clinical, and lifestyle variables** collected from over 150,000 participants across the U.S. It includes variables such as:

- Age, gender, and smoking status
- Screening test results and follow-up diagnostics
- Family history of cancer
- Medical history and vital statistics

The data is commonly used for:
- **Early detection research**
- **Risk prediction modeling**
- **Survival analysis**
- **Feature selection in ML models related to cancer prognosis**

> 📎 Due to the sensitive nature of the dataset, researchers must apply for access through the NCI's Cancer Data Access System (CDAS).
